===============================

Code to accompany the article at
<http://www.bottlenose.demon.co.uk/article/lru.htm>

To build and run the tests it should suffice to do

    cd test
    make

(tested on Debian Squeeze with gcc 4.4.5 installed;
dependencies include libboost-dev and libboost-test-dev
which are versions 1.42.0 on Squeeze).

The reusable headers are in the include/ directory.
